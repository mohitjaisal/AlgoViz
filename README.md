# AlgoViz

It's a visualizer for sorting algorithms to see how they work with real values. It's implemented with React.js, some minimal material UI, and sorting algorithms in Javascript.

## Features
- **Algorithm Visualization:** Explore a wide range of algorithms and data structures through interactive visualizations.
- **Step-by-Step Explanation:** Understand each step of the algorithm with detailed explanations alongside the visual representation.
- **Custom Inputs:** Test algorithms with your own input values to see how they behave in different scenarios.
- **Real-time Execution:** Watch the algorithm in action as it processes your input data and generates results.
- **Code Snippets:** Access the source code of each algorithm and data structure for further study.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation
- To run AlgoViz locally on your machine, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohitjaisal/AlgoViz.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd AlgoViz
```

- Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

* Set up the environment variables:
  * Rename the .env.example file to .env.
  * Fill in the required values for the environment variables.

- Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

> Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access AlgoViz.

## Usage
* Once you have the application up and running, here are a few pointers on how to use AlgoViz:
 * Browse the available algorithms and data structures from the home page.
 * Click on an algorithm to view its visualization and explanation.
 * Follow the step-by-step breakdown to understand how the algorithm works.
 * Use the custom input feature to provide your own data for the algorithm.
 * Watch the real-time execution of the algorithm and observe how it processes your input.
 * Access the source code snippets to study the implementation details.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
